    The 8080 Project // 42nd Division
    BY UNINHIBITED
    © 2021 The 8080 Project // 42nd Division

    A website for an anti-censorship project. The name is a reference to the 8080 port, which is the port used for HTTP. The 42nd Division is a reference to the answer to life, the universe, and everything, and the idea that the project has had many iterations before this one.

    The website is designed to be accessible to even the most rudimentary text-only browsers and Firefox 2.0 and Internet Explorer 6.0.
